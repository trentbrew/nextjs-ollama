- Track feature implementations and their architecture
- Maintain a list of known issues and limitations
- Outline future improvements and TODO items
- Preserve context for future development work

2. **Document issues**: Note any workarounds or technical debt created
3. **Include context**: Explain why decisions were made, not just what was done
4. **Add resources**: Link to relevant documentation or articles
5. **Use markdown formatting**: For better readability (code blocks, headings, etc.)

## Usage

Feel free to create new entries when:

- Implementing significant new features
- Making architectural changes
- Solving complex bugs
- Exploring new technologies or approaches
- Setting up development plans or TODOs
